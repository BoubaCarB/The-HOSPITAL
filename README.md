Overview

This project combines two earlier C++ programs — a Hospital Management System and a Sentiment Analysis Program — into one integrated system. The hospital part focuses on managing patients, clinics, and operations using queues, files, and data validation, while the sentiment analysis part focuses on analyzing written feedback and calculating overall sentiment scores.

By combining both, the goal is to create a system that not only manages hospital operations efficiently but can also analyze patient feedback to improve decision-making and service quality.

Current Progress

The hospital section currently handles patient registration, queue management, and transaction logging for multiple clinics. The sentiment module processes text feedback using word sentiment values from a dataset. Together, these two systems lay the foundation for a more complete hospital platform that connects patient management with feedback analysis.

Next Steps

Work is ongoing to expand the system with additional features such as ambulance tracking, room management, and automated feedback summaries at the end of each workday.
