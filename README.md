Overview

This project combines two earlier C++ programs — a Hospital Management System and a Sentiment Analysis Program — into one integrated system. The hospital part focuses on managing patients, clinics, and operations using queues, files, and data validation, while the sentiment analysis part focuses on analyzing written feedback and calculating overall sentiment scores.

The Goal is to create a system that not only manages hospital operations efficiently but can also analyze patient feedback

Current Progress



Work is ongoing to expand the system with additional features
