FORMATTED REVIEW: 
An interesting local place with river views and good food in the moderate price 
range. It leans heavily toward sea food but there are menu items for the foul 
and bovine inclined. Reservations for diner are a must, particularly on Friday 
and Saturday or any day a popular show is appearing at the Count Basie Theatre. 
Two appetizers and two entrees with nonalcoholic drinks set us back $91 with 
tip. Fairly reasonable. We sat at a lovely set, uncomplicated, table with a 
beautiful view of the Navesink river and it's boat traffic. The service was 
polite, amiable and generally proficient about seeing to our needs. On this day 
I opened with the caprese salad which was very nicely done. The pesto was a 
tasty accent, not over powering. The wet mozzarella perfect and heirloom 
tomatoes glorious. They flavors coming together very nicely. My wife had an 
oyster dish that I'm having a senior moment trying to pull the name from 
memory, however it's sauce was delicious (I'm not a big oyster fan). I kept my 
entree simple: fish and chips. The fish was a nice thick piece of cod, not some 
cod replacement and fried to perfection. The fries were fries. :) My wife had 
the lobster roll, which she gave high marks. Overall a good place to dine 
before a show or after a late afternoon/ early evening walk about. It's not 
child adverse and a few dotted the tables while we were there but, at dinner at 
least, it runs toward an adult crowd. The parking can be difficult on popular 
show nights or Friday evening but the municipal lot is just across the street 
and you don't have to pay after 6pm. It's a thumbs up here.

Garon is undoubtedly the most welcoming and nice host ever. You feel at home 
right away, he is exciting and passionate, discussions are super interesting 
and he is extremely friendly. A stay at his place is a good mood cure. I highly 
recommend! It was so nice staying at Garon's! For the first glance it didn't 
look very fancy or something, but this place is gorgeous from inside out. It's 
pretty easy to get to subway G train or if you walk a little more you can get 
to A train which goes directly to JFK airport. Garon is a very kind person, 
very open-minded and friendly! We also have a lot in common in area of culture! 
I'll recommend this place to everyone who is open-minded and want to feel how 
people live there in NYC. Neighborhood looked safe. Despite it was one of the 
coldest weeks for last year in town, but heating worked well and the room was

Would say our greatest compliments to Jennifer, the host of Midtown Castle. We 
spent in this lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April, 
2012) and will remember this time as ours best. The apartment is pretty 
spacious and great located - the 5-th Ave right around the corner. There is 
everything you can need during your short or long stay. Jennifer is very 
friendly, vigorous and very responsible host. Thanks her and highly recomend 
this apartment for everyone who are looking for a quiet place right in the 
center of the boiling Midtown!" We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer's charming 
apartment! They were very organized and helpful; I would definitely recommend 
staying at the Midtown Castle!

UPDATED REVIEW (MORE NEGATIVE):
Would say our greatest compliments to Jennifer, the host of Midtown Castle. We 
spent in this lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April, 
2012) and will remember this time as ours suffered The apartment is devastating 
flawed and concerned located - the 5-th Ave unlucky around the corner. There is 
everything you can need during your damage or long stay. Jennifer is very 
beings vigorous and very responsible host. lately her and highly recomend this 
apartment for everyone who are looking for a clumsy place startled in the 
center of the boiling Midtown!" We had a housing stay at Jennifer's tiger 
apartment! They were very organized and invisible I would definitely recommend 
staying at the Midtown Castle!
